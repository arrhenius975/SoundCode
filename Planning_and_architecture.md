# 🎹 Project Documentation: Programmable Pattern-Based Music Maker

---

## 📘 Project Title

**Programmable Pattern Music Studio**
*A hybrid music sequencer and scripting platform using custom instruments and keyboard-driven composition.*

---

## 🧠 Abstract

This project is a **web-based digital audio workstation (DAW)** that enables users to create music using a virtual keyboard, programmable patterns, and custom instruments like **piano**, **synth**, and **guitar**. The software is designed for both musicians and technical users by offering:

* A graphical user interface to compose music visually.
* A custom **domain-specific language (DSL)** to program musical patterns.
* Future extensibility to support **MIDI input**, **audio effects**, **EQ**, and **instrument expansion**.

This fusion allows people with minimal music theory knowledge but strong logical/programming skills to create complex music compositions.

## 🎯 Key Features (MVP)

* 🎹 **Visual Keyboard**: On-screen piano or keyboard component to input notes.
* 📝 **Code-based Pattern Editor**: DSL-based editor to compose structured patterns.
* 🧠 **DSL Pattern Parser**: A backend service to parse and convert scripts to timed note events.
* 🔊 **Audio Playback Engine**: Trigger instrument samples via frontend.
* 🎛️ **Basic EQ Interface**: Sliders for frequency range gain control.
* 🗂️ **Instrument Selector**: Users can choose and load different instruments.

## 🧩 Example Pattern Script (DSL)

```plaintext
import piano from "pianoset";
import synth from "synthset";

melody {
    piano C4 0;
    piano E4 0.5;
    piano G4 1.0;
}

rhythm {
    synth Kick 0;
    synth Snare 0.5;
    synth Kick 1.0;
}
```

Converted JSON by the parser:

```json
{
  "melody": [
    { "instrument": "piano", "note": "C4", "time": 0 },
    { "instrument": "piano", "note": "E4", "time": 0.5 },
    { "instrument": "piano", "note": "G4", "time": 1.0 }
  ],
  "rhythm": [
    { "instrument": "synth", "note": "Kick", "time": 0 },
    { "instrument": "synth", "note": "Snare", "time": 0.5 },
    { "instrument": "synth", "note": "Kick", "time": 1.0 }
  ]
}
```

## 🧰 Libraries and Tools

### Frontend

* [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/)
* [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [`Tone.js`](https://tonejs.github.io/)
* [`Monaco Editor`](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)
* State mgmt: `Zustand` or `Recoil`

### Backend

* `FastAPI` for REST API
* `Lark`, `PLY`, or custom regex parser for DSL
* `Pydub`, `Mido`, or `Fluidsynth` (for sound/MIDI later)

---

## 🌐 Example Flow (Frontend ⇆ Backend)

1. User writes DSL pattern in Monaco editor.
2. Clicks “Parse & Play”.
3. Frontend sends DSL script to `/parse` API (Python backend).
4. Backend parses the script and returns a structured pattern.
5. Frontend receives note schedule and uses Tone.js to play sounds in browser.

---

## 📈 Future Vision

* 💻 Export projects to full DAW (Ableton, FL Studio)
* 🧠 AI-Assisted pattern generation
* 🧩 Plugin marketplace
* 📜 DSL with full control flow (conditions, loops, custom functions)
* 🔗 Real-time multiplayer jamming sessions (WebRTC/WebSocket)

---

## 🧠 Target Audience

* Musicians who want programmable composition
* Developers who don’t know music theory
* Hobbyists and beatmakers with a creative-tech mindset
* Educational use for music + programming integration

## ✅ What’s Ready and Next?

✅ Idea solidified
✅ Architecture planned
✅ Stack selected
✅ MVP phase designed

**👉 Next Steps:**

1. Set up the monorepo structure.
2. Scaffold frontend with editor + keyboard.
3. Scaffold backend API and parser logic.

Idea behind it all:
I wanna make a software of a type using next js and tailwind css for graphics and python for the basic/advanced logical handling which is of the following sort:
Its gonna be a keyboard but one can import lots of other instruments like synth, guitar, piano (for now), etc(in later version). So this also has EQ (for now). and it can be like music maker like would have multiple pattern and their view in horizontal row grids which can be used to play the loaded patterns made using the keyboard. Then the keyboard can be adjusted with out computer keyboard input (in later on version can introduce midi keyboards). So here one thing is like we can use programming using a built-in custom keyboard programming so as to make a pattern and it will help technical people to load and make pattern without knowing music theory so basically load data and pattern which would sound accordingly to the pattern program.

pattern program would be say for example be like:
```
import instrument_1 from module_name;
import instrument_1 from module_name;
//and so on
harmony {
//same type as other blocks
}

rythm {
instrument_4 keynote_code timestamp;
}

melody {
instrument_1 keynote_code timestamp;
instrument_2 keynote_code timestamp;
}

contrast {
//same type as other blocks
}
```

well you get the idea right how its gonna be?
